# Hey, I'm Jon! 

I'm currently a fourth-year student at Seattle Pacific University, studying **Physics** and **Applied Mathematics**, also pursuing a degree in **Honors Liberal Arts** and a minor in **Data Analytics**. Check out [my resume](https://github.com/jonmgeiger/resume/blob/main/geiger_resume.pdf) for more info about my work history and specific skillset.

### I'm interested in: 
- **Data Science and Data Communication**. Data should be both accessible and comprehensible, and that proper data communication should be unbiased and informative. 
- **Physics Education**. I've worked as as a Learning Assistant for SPU's Physics department for the last three years, and have become fascinated with how students formulate ideas about physics. In particular, I'm interested in the connection between students' tacit life experience and how they interpret physics questions through a unique lens.
- **Computer Building & Mechanical Keyboards**! Tinkering with computers has always been a hobby of mine, and I love talking computer hardware with people.

### I'm currently working on: 
- My [honors thesis](https://github.com/jonmgeiger-honors-project), "Developing a Natural Language Processing Approach for Categorizing Student Ideas in Introductory Calculus-based Physics."
- [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/jonmgeiger/islr-notes)! I'm making my way through _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_, taking notes and doing exercises as I go. 
- A [collaborative data analysis project](https://github.com/noelgoodwin/household-conditions), looking at household Conditions by geographic school district for my Data Analytics capstone class. 

### I'm looking forward to: 
- Interviewing for Data Science positions. I'm currently searching for entry-level Data Scientist positions around the Seattle, WA area, hoping to start in Summer or Fall of 2022. 
- Graduating! I'll be finishing my undergraduate degrees in June 2022, looking to move into the field afterwards.
- Graduate School? I'm hoping to pursue a graduate degree in Applied Mathematics/Statistics, currently looking at concentrations in Statistical/Machine Learning with applications in data science education.
