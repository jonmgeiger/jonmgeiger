# Hey, I'm Jon! 

I'm currently a fourth-year student at Seattle Pacific University, studying **Physics** and **Applied Mathematics**, also pursuing a degree in **Honors Liberal Arts** and a minor in **Data Analytics**. 

### I'm interested in: 
- **Data Science and Data Communication**. Data should be both accessible and comprehensible, and that proper data communication should be unbiased and informative. 
- **Physics Education**. I've worked as as a Learning Assistant for SPU's Physics department for the last three years, and have become fascinated with how students formulate ideas about physics. In particular, I'm interested in the connection between students' tacit life experience and how they interpret physics questions through a unique lens.

### I'm currently working on: 
- My [honors thesis](https://github.com/jonmgeiger-honors-project), characterizing student ideas in undergraduate physics using Natural Language Processing. 
- [Statistical Learning](https://github.com/jonmgeiger/islr-notes)! I'm making my way through _An Introduction to Statistical Learning_, taking notes and doing exercises as I go. 

### I'm looking forward to: 
- Interviewing for Data Science positions. I'm currently searching for entry-level Data Scientist positions around the Seattle, WA area, hoping to start in Summer or Fall of 2022. 
- Graduating! I'll be finishing my undergraduate degrees in June 2022, looking to move into the field afterwards.
- Graduate School? I'm hoping to pursue a graduate degree in Applied Mathematics/Statistics, currently hoping to focus on Statistical/Machine Learning
